# NextJS + TypeScript + Amplify Gen 2

This repo accompanies this video and is mainly for reference: [Getting Started with NextJS and AWS Amplify Gen 2](https://youtu.be/HV_oiZWUJXc).

What we have here is a demo app to show NextJS working with AWS Amplify Gen 2. It's the beginning of an app that will allow...

- all users (authenticated and unauthenticated) to add items to a shopping cart
- authenticated users to rate and review products
- authenticated users to customize a user profile
- authenticated users to checkout and submit payment information (Stripe in demo/dev mode)
- admin users to create, update and delete products, including uploading images

Those features will allow us to exercise various Amazon services via Amplify, including Cognito, DynamoDB, S3, Lambda, and AppSync (GraphQL).

The app currently has the following capabilities:

- sign up, sign in and sign out
- creating, updating and deleting products
- adding a single image to a product

The code in this repo currently demonstrates...

- auth configuration in amplify/auth/resource.ts that creates an "Admins" group and specifies that users will sign in using an email address
- a schema in amplify/data/resource.ts for a Product model
- permissions that allow authenticated and unauthenticated users to read the Product data
- permissions that allow members of the Admins group to create, update and delete Product items
- configuration of an S3 bucket for storing product images
- in utils/amplify-utils.ts the creation of a cookie-based client for accessing data, and determining for determining signed-in and admin status, from server-side-rendered pages
- utils/middleware.ts middleware for limiting access to admin/ pages to admin users
- customizing "connected forms" generated by Amplify from the data schema
- using Amplify's Authenticator client component and context provider
- an admin context provider and custom hook so that client components can determine whether of not a user is an admin
- use of Amplify's StorageManager and StorageImage React components
